- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/checkwise
cd checkwise
npm install
```

### 2. Development Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or 20+
- npm 9+
- Git

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Development Commands
```bash
# Run tests (do this frequently!)
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Build the action
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run lint

# Development mode with TypeScript watching
npm run dev
```

#### Project Structure

### 3. Making Changes

#### Code Guidelines
- **TypeScript**: Use strict TypeScript with proper typing
- **Testing**: Write tests for all new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update docs for any API changes
- **Commits**: Use conventional commit messages

#### Testing Guidelines
- Maintain test coverage above 95%
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Include integration tests for GitHub API interactions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test

# Check coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Test specific file
npm test -- config.test.ts
```

#### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

### 4. Submitting Changes

#### Before Submitting
1. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure all tests pass
2. **Build successfully**: Run `npm run build`
3. **Update documentation**: If you've changed APIs or added features
4. **Add tests**: For new functionality
5. **Follow commit conventions**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages

#### Pull Request Process
1. **Create a descriptive PR title**: Follow conventional commits format
2. **Fill out the PR template**: Don't skip sections
3. **Link related issues**: Use "Closes #123" or "Relates to #123"
4. **Request review**: Wait for maintainer review
5. **Address feedback**: Make requested changes promptly

#### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of what changed and why.

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
- **Modularity**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Write code that's easy to test
- **Security**: Validate all inputs and handle errors gracefully
- **Performance**: Consider GitHub API rate limits and large repositories

### Security Considerations
- Never log sensitive information (tokens, file contents)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure defaults
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Performance Guidelines
- Minimize GitHub API calls
- Use efficient glob patterns
- Handle large file lists gracefully
- Cache results when appropriate
